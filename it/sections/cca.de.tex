% 		% && {\small Carried out Photon Statistics experiments in the photonics lab. Created equipment interfacing scripts on Linux using \code{Python 3} with libraries such as \code{pyusb} and automated said scripts for repeated data acquisition and processing. Aggregated and analysed large datasets with \code{numpy} and \code{gnuplot}. Also enabled remote monitoring, experimentation and extraction of data without physical access to the lab through reverse \code{SSH}. } \\
